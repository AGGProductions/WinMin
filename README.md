This is a work in progress multistage app that will grant admin very easily just will be a pain for me to code.

This program is currently in beta but is safe enough to run it on a computer without something bad happening.

Current things that WinMin Does
1. Grants administrator user prievleges using the built-in administrator
2. Automatically changes the password on every startup to Password1 so you can always use the admin account
3. Has a user interface to easily open command prompt and to access the registry editor
4. Has the option to enable or disable all windows settings and right click using the WinMin interface by clicking one button (edits the registry)
5. Allows you to run any program with admin through the WinMin interface

Things to add in the future
1. Reg key loading, as well as having a repo to hold the keys and allow people to apply those keys with a key of the button automatically
2. Finish system level registry key changing at system startup before the user logs in.
3. Be able to drag an app onto the WinMin icon to launch the app with administrator permissions or have some right click menu for it.
