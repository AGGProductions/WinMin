# WinMin

This is a work in progress multistage app that will grant admin very easily just will be a pain for me to code.

Road Map
1. Modify windows pe to run the program (About 60% Complete)
2. ~~Run the program on the lock screen in windows~~
3. Make a windows service to keep the password the same (About 10% Complete)
4. Make a wpf app to handle the installing of the windows service
5. Make an app that can update and control the service
