# WinAdmin

This is a work in progress multistage app that will grant admin very easily just will be a pain for me to code.

Road Map
1. Modify windows pe to run the program (About 60% Complete)
2. ~~Run the program on the lock screen in windows~~
3. Make a windows service to keep the password the same
4. Make a wpf app to handle thethe installing of the windows service

PS. i might be forgetting some things but ill update this when i remember what it was
