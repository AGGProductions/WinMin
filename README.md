# WinMin

This is a work in progress multistage app that will grant admin very easily just will be a pain for me to code.

Road Map
1. Modify windows pe to run the program (About 90% Complete)
2. ~~Run the program on the lock screen in windows~~
3. Make an app that can update and use the admin perms (About 80% Complete)
4. Make the setup program to copy the files to the pc (10% Complete)
