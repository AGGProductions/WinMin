# WinMin

This is a work in progress multistage app that will grant admin very easily just will be a pain for me to code.

Road Map
1. ~~Modify windows pe to run the program~~
2. ~~Run the program on the lock screen in windows~~
3. ~~Make an app that can update and use the admin perms~~
4. ~~Make the setup program to copy the files to the pc~~
